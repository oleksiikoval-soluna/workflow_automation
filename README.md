## Technology Used and How It Works

### > Technology Stack :

#### 1. **Django**
   - **Role**: Backend Framework
   - **Description**: Django is used to build the RESTful API that handles data processing, authentication, and storage. It provides a robust and scalable foundation for the backend.
   - **How It Works**:
     - Django receives client data from the frontend via API requests.
     - It processes the data, performs validations, and stores it in the PostgreSQL database.
     - Django also integrates with Zapier to trigger workflow automation.

#### 2. **Next.js**
   - **Role**: Frontend Framework
   - **Description**: Next.js is used to build a responsive and dynamic web application that allows clients to submit their requests and view responses.
   - **How It Works**:
     - The frontend communicates with the Django backend via REST API.
     - It provides a user-friendly interface for clients to input their data and view the status of their requests.

#### 3. **Zapier**
   - **Role**: Workflow Automation
   - **Description**: Zapier is used to automate tasks between the web application and project management tools like Monday.com.
   - **How It Works**:
     - When a client submits a request, Zapier triggers an automation to create a new task in Monday.com.
     - It also sends email notifications to the relevant team members and updates the client once the request is resolved.

#### 4. **Monday.com**
   - **Role**: Project Management Tool
   - **Description**: Monday.com is used to manage and track client requests as tasks.
   - **How It Works**:
     - Tasks are automatically created in Monday.com when a client submits a request.
     - Team members can update the status of tasks, and the client is notified via email once the task is resolved.

#### 5. **PostgreSQL**
   - **Role**: Database
   - **Description**: PostgreSQL is used as the primary database to store client data and request details.
   - **How It Works**:
     - All client data and request information are securely stored in PostgreSQL.
     - The Django backend interacts with PostgreSQL to retrieve and update data as needed.

#### 6. **Render**
   - **Role**: Backend Deployment
   - **Description**: Render is used to deploy the Django backend.
   - **How It Works**:
     - The Django application is hosted on Render, providing a scalable and reliable backend service.
     - Render automatically handles environment variables, database connections, and deployment pipelines.

#### 7. **Vercel**
   - **Role**: Frontend Deployment
   - **Description**: Vercel is used to deploy the Next.js frontend.
   - **How It Works**:
     - The Next.js application is hosted on Vercel, ensuring fast and efficient delivery of the frontend to users.
     - Vercel provides automatic builds and deployments whenever changes are pushed to the repository.


### > How It Works :
1. **Client Submits a Request**:
   - The client fills out a form on the Next.js frontend and submits their request.
   - The data is sent to the Django backend via an API request.

2. **Backend Processes the Request**:
   - Django validates the data and stores it in the PostgreSQL database.
   - Zapier is triggered to create a new task in Monday.com and send email notifications to the team.

3. **Team Handles the Request**:
   - The team updates the task status in Monday.com as they work on the request.
   - Once the request is resolved, Zapier sends an email notification to the client.

4. **Client Receives Updates**:
   - The client can view the status of their request on the frontend.
   - They receive an email notification once their request is resolved.

    git clone https://github.com/arvinaufal/workflow-automation-carbonethics.git
    ```
  + Move to the project folder
    ```bash
    cd workflow-automation-carbonethics
    ```

#### 2. Set up the backend:
  + Move to the backend project folder from your root project folder
    ```bash
      cd backend
    ```

  + Install the required packages
    ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
  + In the backend project folder, add a `.env` file with the following content:
    ```env
      ZAPIER_WEBHOOK_URL=YOUR ZAPIER WEBHOOK URL
      DATABASE_URL=YOUR DATABASE URL
      DEBUG=True
    ```

  + Create the database on your local computer or live database

  + Create a virtual environment
    ```bash
      python -m venv venv
    ```

  + Run the virtual environment
    ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
  
  + Run the migration
    ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

  + Run the development server
    ```bash
      python manage.py runserver
    ```

#### 3. Set up the frontend:
  + Move to the frontend project folder from your root project folder
    ```bash
      cd frontend
    ```
  + Install the required packages
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

  + In the frontend project folder, add a `.env` file with the following content:
    ```bash
      NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=YOUR API URL
    ```

  + Run the development project
    ```bash
      npm run dev
